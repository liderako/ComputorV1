### Description

This project is the first of a series to refresh your knowledge about basic mathematical concepts,
which will be very useful for many of the following projects. It is not a question of "doing math
for math's sake", but to allow you to advance in the necessary topics at a steady pace.
You are allowed to choose a language to implement this subject.
